SOLID Principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - Each class should have only one responsibility.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
